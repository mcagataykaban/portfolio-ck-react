              I love doing deep research on topics that I am interested in and I
              am confident in my self-learning ability. I have an
              entrepreneurial spirit with strong teamwork and leadership skills.
              Also, I have 2 years of freelance web development and startup
              experience. I received strong formal software development
              training. In the future, I want to improve my skills in the
              professional environment.
